## "The Story"

Beneath the flickering neon haze of Cyber City, the streets choke on smoke and stolen voltage. Towers buzz like dying insects. Power lines bleed sparks into puddles of oil and rain.

High above, the iron tyrant Cyber Mech has unleashed his soul-drained droids—mechanical leeches that suck the city dry while guarding the sacred AI chips that keep his empire alive.

The people hide in the dark.

But one pilot does not.

You are Neo-Striker — the last rogue combat jet forged before the grid collapsed. You were built to protect. Rewired to obey. But you chose to rebel.

Tonight, you fly alone.

Your mission:
Tear through the droid gates.
Rip back every stolen AI chip.
Break Cyber Mech’s grip on the skyline.

Because if one machine can stand against tyranny… maybe anyone can.

## --- TIME ---

### "Time Is Power"

In Cyber City, power is time.

Your clock boots at **5 seconds** — a dying pulse in a dying city.

Every droid gate you slice through drains their stolen energy and feeds it into you. Their power becomes your seconds.

Boost through them. Shatter them.
**+10 seconds per pair destroyed.**

When your clock hits zero, the lights go out.

And Cyber City stays enslaved.

---

## --- HEALTH ---

### "Steel Can Break"

Neo-Striker runs on **3 health bars**.

Every collision with a droid tears plating from your hull — **1 bar lost.**

When you’re down to your final hit, the world slows. You have **1.5 seconds** to ignite a boost or fire a laser. A heartbeat to decide whether you fall… or fight.

If your clock shows **1:15 or more** and your hull is damaged, a choice appears:

**Trade 60 seconds for 1 health bar.**

Because sometimes survival costs time.
And sometimes time is worth fighting for.

---

## --- BOOSTS ---

### "Rage Ignition"

Every **5 droid gates** you conquer earns **1 Boost**.
Stack up to **100**.

Triggering a Boost unleashes **2.5 seconds of invincible fury.**

You become a comet of vengeance.
You smash through droids like broken chains.
Each pair destroyed: **+10 seconds.**

Their stolen power becomes your rebellion.

---

## --- LASERS ---

### "Judgment Fire"

For every **3 Boosts**, you earn **1 Laser charge.**
Stack up to **100.**

Fire it.

Twin beams of pure rebellion erupt for **3 seconds**, vaporizing every droid in your path — even Cyber Mech himself.

For those 3 seconds, the sky belongs to you.

---

## --- MECH BOSS ---

### "The Tyrant Descends"

Every **10 chips** you reclaim, Cyber Mech crashes down from the smog to take them back.

From **Level 10 onward**, he grows desperate — attacking every **5 chips** instead.

Hit him with a Boost charge.
Burn him with a Laser blast.

Defeat him and you earn:

* **+5 chips**
* A **Level Up**

After Level 10, he grows **10% larger** each encounter — a towering monument to fear.

But no matter how massive he becomes…
He can still fall.

---

## --- SPEED ---

### "Escalation"

Every **10 levels**, the droids accelerate.

The skyline blurs.
The gates narrow.
The pressure builds.

By the time you approach **Level 100**, Cyber City itself feels like it’s trying to shake you loose.

Stay sharp.
Stay angry.
Stay alive.

---

## --- VICTORY ---

### "Liberation"

Reach **Level 100.**

Defeat Cyber Mech for the final time.
Shatter the droid grid.
Free the stolen AI chips.

When Neo-Striker takes enough chips…
When the droids lie in smoking ruin…
When Cyber Mech falls from the sky…

The lights come back on.

Cyber City breathes again.

And here’s the truth hidden beneath the steel and sparks:

Neo-Striker fights alone —
but the rebellion is bigger than one jet.

Every gate you pass.
Every second you earn.
Every time you refuse to fall.

That’s resistance.

That’s hope.

That’s proof that even in the dirtiest, darkest city…
power can be taken back.

And maybe you were never just playing.

Maybe you were practicing.

For your own Cyber City.
