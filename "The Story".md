"The Story"

"Deep in the neon-lit corridors of Cyber City, the Mech Boss has scattered precious data chips across the sk

"You are Neo-Striker, a rogue combat jet built to fight back. Your mission: fly through the droid gates, collect every chip, and destroy the Mech Boss before time runs out."


// --- TIME ---
"Time"

"Your clock starts at just 5 seconds. Every droid gate you pass adds precious time. When you boost through droids and shatter them, you earn +10 seconds. But if the clock hits zero, it's game over."


// --- HEALTH ---
"Health"

"Neo-Striker has 3 health bars. Each collision with a droid costs 1 bar. When you're down to your last hit, you have 1.5 seconds to activate a boost or laser to save yourself."

"If you have 1:15 or more on the clock and are missing health, a Trade button appears. Tap it to trade 60 seconds for 1 health bar."


// --- BOOSTS ---
"Boosts"

"For every 5 droid gates you pass, you earn 1 boost. You can stack up to 100. Activating a boost gives 2.5 seconds of invincible free flight. While boosting, you smash through droids and earn +10 seconds per pair destroyed."


// --- LASERS ---
"Lasers"

"For every 3 boosts you earn, you receive 1 laser charge. Stack up to 100. Firing a laser unleashes twin beams for 3 seconds, vaporizing every droid and the Mech Boss in your path."


// --- MECH BOSS ---
"Mech Boss"

"Every 10 chips you collect, the Mech Boss drops from the sky to reclaim his chips. From Level 10 onward, he grows bolder and returns every 5 chips instead."

"Hit him with a boost charge or a laser blast to defeat him. Each victory rewards +5 chips and a level up. After Level 10, he grows 10% larger each encounter."


// --- SPEED ---
"Speed"

"The droids accelerate every 10 levels, pushing Neo-Striker closer to the edge. Stay sharp as the pace intensifies on the road to Level 100."

"Reach Level 100 to defeat the Mech Boss once and for all and liberate Cyber City!"
